# geogebra-ipados-text-fix

Fix issues while editing object names or while adding custom text on GeoGebra. Intended for iPadOS and/or iOS. It should have no effect on desktop devices.

- It's not possible to write anything with an external keyboard using the "Text" object.

This Userscript aims to fix that. Here you can see the "Before" and "After" for editing the object names:
