## What this does:

Normally, all GeoGebra web apps on iPadOS has two issues:

- While editing the object names, or saving the file, the textbox value appears to be duplicated;
- It's not possible to write anything with an external keyboard using the "Text" object.

This Userscript aims to fix that.

 Here you can see the "Before" and "After" for editing the object names:
